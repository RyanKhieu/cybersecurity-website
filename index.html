            <div class="card">
                <h2>What You Know</h2>
                <p>This type of authentication relies on something the user knows, like a password or PIN. It is the simplest form of authentication but can be vulnerable to attacks like phishing.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h2>What You Have</h2>
                <p>This type of authentication relies on something the user possesses, like a security token, smart card, or mobile device. It adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h2>What You Are</h2>
                <p>This type of authentication relies on the user's unique biological traits, like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. It is considered one of the most secure forms of authentication.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Multifactor Authentication</h2>
                <p>This type of authentication combines two or more of the other factors to verify a user's identity. This can include a combination of something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (like a token), and something the user is (like a fingerprint).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Strong Passwords</h2>
                <p>Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It should not be less than 12 characters long and not contain easily guessable information like birthdays or dictionary words.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Lockout</h2>
                <p>Temporarily disables access after a certain number of failed login attempts. This helps to prevent unauthorized access through guessing.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Multifactor Authentication</h2>
                <p>Even if passwords are compromised, multifactor authentication can help protect user accounts by requiring additional verification methods.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Hashing</h2>
                <p>Hashing is a process that transforms a password into a hash value. This hash value is stored instead of the actual password. When a user logs in, the system hashes the entered password and compares it to the stored hash value. If they match, access is granted. The hash value cannot be converted back to the original password, making it more difficult for attackers to obtain users' passwords.</p>

        <div class="cards-container">
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Phishing</h2>
                <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to fool users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. This is often done through fake emails, messages, or websites.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Spear-phishing</h2>
                <p>A targeted form of phishing where attackers focus on a specific individual, organization, or business, often using personalized information to make their attack more convincing. This can involve spoofing email addresses or creating fake websites that resemble legitimate ones.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
